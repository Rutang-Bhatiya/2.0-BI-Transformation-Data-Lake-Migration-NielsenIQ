# BI Transformation & Data Lake Migration – NielsenIQ  
**Modernizing Analytics from Legacy Reporting to Enterprise BI (Discover)**

---

## 1️⃣ Background

This repository represents the **second phase of my career at NielsenIQ**, where I transitioned from traditional reporting into a **BI-focused role**.

The primary objective of this phase was to **migrate legacy reports** built on Answers into **Discover**, a large-scale enterprise data lake and BI platform.

This role required not only technical understanding, but also **change management, customer education, and governance awareness**.

All examples in this repository use **dummy data** to respect confidentiality.

## 2️⃣ Scope & Responsibility

- Migrated legacy Answers-based reports into **Discover**
- Worked with large-scale **data lake structures**
- Helped customers adopt a **completely new BI tool**
- Explained new data models, logic differences, and access rules
- Ensured business questions were still answered — even if reports looked different

This role shifted focus from **report replication** to **analytical modernization**.

## 2.1 Legacy Reporting (Answers) vs Discover (BI Platform)

Legacy tools were highly structured and report-centric.  
Discover introduced a **data model–driven, exploratory analytics approach**.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Legacy (Answers) | Discover |
|-----|-----------------|----------|
| Data Access | Predefined extracts | Centralized data lake |
| Report Style | Fixed layouts | Flexible, exploratory |
| Logic | Embedded in reports | Model-driven |
| Scalability | Limited | Enterprise-scale |

The migration required **rethinking reports**, not copy-pasting them.

## 2.2 Report Redesign & Business Logic Translation

Reports were rebuilt to:
- Answer the **same business questions**
- Avoid replicating outdated layouts
- Leverage Discover’s strengths

### Redesign Principles
- Focus on **business intent**, not visual similarity
- Simplify KPIs where possible
- Use standardized metrics from the data model
- Reduce dependency on manual logic

This often meant telling customers:
> “You will get the same answer, but not the same old report.”

## 2.3 Data Governance, Masking & Access Rules

![Governance & Masking]

Discover introduced stricter **data governance**.

### Responsibilities
- Explained **masking rules** to customers
- Clarified why certain data was:
  - Hidden
  - Aggregated
  - Restricted by role
- Ensured compliance with internal and external policies

This required balancing:
- Transparency
- Security
- Customer expectations

## 2.4 Customer Enablement & Change Management

A major part of this role was **customer enablement**.

### Support Provided
- Guided customers through Discover’s interface
- Explained:
  - New data structures
  - KPI definitions
  - Differences vs legacy logic
- Helped customers adjust their analytical mindset

### Outcome
Customers learned to:
- Explore data independently
- Trust centralized metrics
- Move away from rigid, static reporting

This phase strengthened my **communication and stakeholder management skills**.
